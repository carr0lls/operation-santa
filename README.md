# Operation Santa
Give a warm Christmas gift to families who are in need.

## Description
This web app supports universal rendering via ReactJS, routing with React-Router, and Postmates' API to get delivery quotes and create deliveries for users. There is no flux implementation as this was meant to be a small project (MVP).

## Prerequisites
- [Operation Santa API](https://github.com/phchung/Operation_Santa)
- Alternative to API pre-req: Checkout 'live' branch instead

## To run

```sh
npm install

# Transpile and bundle client, server, and test files
npm run build

# Start server
npm start
```

And visit <http://localhost:4000/> to access GUI.
