				<h3>Nominate</h3>
				<article>
					We accept nominations of families in need. You can either nominate your own family 
					or the families of your friends, neighbors, or even co&#45;workers. We choose the families 
					most in need from these nominations and we try our best to help them out by listing them 
					on our website and allowing kind people near them donate gifts to the families!

				<h3>Adopt</h3>
				<article>
					You can sign up to be an adopter to these nominated families. As an adopter, you will 
					be helping a family during the holiday season. You will be matched with a nominated family 
					and you will receive the family&#39;s wishlist. From there you can shop for gifts and 
					basic necessities for the family. Your donations will be picked up from your specified 
					location and delivered to the family. However, you may also have the opportunity to 
					contact the family directly and deliver the gifts personally as well!
